    - no-conflict merge
    - conflict merge: 
        狀況一：column改名 -> 系統不會把它當作conflict, merge conflict (系統假設：原col刪掉、增加一個新的col)
        狀況二：column attr改變 (eg: int -> varchar) -> merge conflict
        狀況三：constraint:
            - PK / FK / columns / table 新增 -> merge success
            - PK / FK / columns / table 刪除 -> merge conflict
